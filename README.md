# OAuth 2.0 for WordPress

Connect applications to your WordPress site without ever giving away your password.

This plugin uses the OAuth 2 protocol to allow delegated authorization; that is, to allow applications to access a site using a set of secondary credentials. This allows server administrators to control which applications can access the site, as well as allowing users to control which applications have access to their data.

This plugin only supports WordPress >= 4.8.

## Proof Key for Code Exchange
OAuth2 plugin supports PKCE as a protection against authorization code interception attack (relevant only for authorization code grant type). In order to use PKCE, on the initial authorization request, add two fields: 
* _code_challenge_ 
* _code_challenge_method_ (optional). 

Code verifier is a 43-128 length random string consisting of [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "_" / "~". Code challenge is derived from the code verifier depending on the challenge method. Two types are supported, 's256' and 'plain'. Plain is just code_challenge = code_verifier. s256 method uses SHA256 to hash the code verifier and then do a base64 encoding of the resulting hash. e.g.

```code_verifier = 052edd3941bb8040ecac75d2359d7cd1abe2518911b
code_challenge = base64( sha256( code_verifier ) ) = MmNmZTJlNGZhYmNmYzQ3YTI4MmRhY2Q1NGEwZDUzZTFiZGFhNTNlODI4MGY3NjM0YWUwNjA1YjYzMmQwNDMxNQ==
code_challenge_method = s256
```

In the next step, when using the code received from the server to obtain an access token, code_verifier must be passed in as an additional field to the request, and it must be using the code_verifier value that was used to calculate the code_challenge in the initial request.

## CLI Commands

### PKCE

A custom WP CLI helper command to generate a random code verifier and a code challenge.

```wp oauth2 generate-code-challenge```

This is in extremely early beta, and does not work yet. Please help us out and contribute!
